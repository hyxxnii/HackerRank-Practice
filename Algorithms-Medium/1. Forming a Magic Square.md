### Problem
> We define a `magic square` to be an $n$ x $n$ matrix of distinct positive integers from $1$ to $n^2$ to  where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length $n$ is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.
> You will be given a $3$ x $3$ matrix $s$ of integers in the inclusive range [$1,9$] . We can convert any digit $a$ to any other digit $b$ in the range [$1,9$] at cost of . 
> Given $s$, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.
>> Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range [$1,9$].
   
>> *magic square(마방진): 가로, 세로, 대각선 방향의 수를 더하면 모두 같은 값 => distinct integers로 채워짐 
   
### Example
$s = [[5, 3, 4], [1, 5, 8], [6, 4, 2]]

The matrix looks like this:
```
5 3 4
1 5 8
6 4 2
```
We can convert it to the following magic square:
```
8 3 4
1 5 9
6 7 2
```
This took three replacements at a cost of $|5-8|+|8-9|+|4-7|=7$
