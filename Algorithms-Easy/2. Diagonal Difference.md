### Problem
> Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
`
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
`
The left-to-right diagonal = $1+5+9=15$. The right to left diagonal =$3+5+9=17$. Their absolute difference is $|15-17|=2$.


### Output Format
Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

### Sample Input
`
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
`

### Sample Output
`15`


### Solving a problem
```python
def diagonalDifference(arr):
    right_diag = 0
    left_diag = 0
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        right_diag += arr[i][i]
        left_diag += arr[i][n-i-1]
    
    result = abs(right_diag - left_diag)
    return result
```
